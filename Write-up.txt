# CTF Write-up: Inside thoughts
Description
Your thoughts in your head kills.

## Solution Steps

1. Identify the SSRF Endpoint
The application has SSRF endpoints at `/fetch-next` in 'previous post' and 'next post' functionality which can be leveraged to ssrf into /admin

2. Discover Internal Services
The endpoint allows requests to the '/admin' hostname, which maps to the internal admin panel.

3. Explore Admin Panel
First, explore what's available on the admin panel and this will reveal available log files including `flag.txt`.

4. Retrieve the Flag
Use the log viewing functionality to read the flag with 'POST' method only. You can either do it in burp suite or in terminal like this:

```
curl -X POST "http://[target]/fetch-next?url=http://admin/logs" \
     -d "log_file=flag.txt" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```
